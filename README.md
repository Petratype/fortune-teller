# Fortune Teller ðŸ”®

A tiny, simple, playful web app that sorts short fortunes (some mystical, some silly). A friend of mine kept giving me fortune cookies so I came up with this.

Built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Wanted to practice DOM methods and small UI effects.

## How to run locally
Open ---URL---

## Features
- Typing animation for each fortune.
- Fun mix of poetic and silly fortunes (Wi-Fi and socks included).
- Single-file frontend: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`.
